- Julia

- This presentation
  - quick overview
  - case study from compute

- Motivations
  - Better language for
    - scientific computing
    - machine learning
    - data mining
  - Steal
    - Speed (C) (http://julialang.org/benchmarks/)
    - Dynamic (Ruby)
    - Macros (Lisp)
    - Familiar notation (Matlab)
    - Distributed (Hadoop)

- Questions to ask when learning a new language?
  - what are the primitives?
    - the usual suspects, plus
    - fancy linalg-oriented arrays
    - dictionaries
    - functions
  - what are the means of combination?
    - structures
    - tuples
  - what are the means of abstraction?
    - functions
    - abstract type classes
    - parametric types
    - multiple dispatch polymorphism

- explore
  - primitives, 
  - arrays, matrices
  - functions
    - blocks
    - optional args
    - keyword args
  - optional typing
    - types
      - composite
      - abstract
  - multiple dispatch
    - promotion/conversion
  - macros
  - parallelism

- case study
  - k-means
    - matrices
    - graphing
    - parallel

- notes
  - excellent language documentation

  - frustrations
    - no covariance (as always, the type system both solves and creates problems)
    - lambdas aren't first class as far as types are concerned
    - still under active development
      - debugging support (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wkw2gmzfm1Q)
    - JITing slow?
